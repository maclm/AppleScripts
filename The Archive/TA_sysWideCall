# This one is to call 'The Archive' from a system wide keyboard shortcut 
# (defined in BetterTouchTool), bringing it up ready to search.  
# It's a replica of nvALT's system wide keboard shortcut, 
# but even better in that it works even if the app isn't running. 

tell application "The Archive" to activate
delay 0.1 # adjust to your system response time
tell application "System Events"
	keystroke "l" using {command down}
end tell
